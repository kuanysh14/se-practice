# Week 09 — Lab Report: canBook as a Tool

Fill in every section. Do not delete or renumber the headings: the README and the checker point at
them. Replace every `<!-- comment -->` with your own text (comments are ignored by the checker).

## 1. Setup

| |   |
| --- |---|
| Assistant (frozen for the whole lab) | Claude |
| Exact model (or "not displayed") | Sonnet 5.5 |
| Three fresh chats for R1, R2, R3? (yes / no) | yes |
| Python version (`python --version`) | 3.14 |

## 2. Your tool definition — a reason for every constraint

Paste your final `tool/check_room.json`, then fill the table: one row per constraint you wrote.

```json

```

| Field | Constraint (e.g. `"type": "integer"`, `"maximum": 1440`) | What goes wrong without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

## 3. The twelve calls — first run and final run

Your **first** run's S verdicts (before any fix), and your final ones. For every case that changed,
say what you changed.

| Case | First run | Final run | What you changed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S01 | | | |
| S02 | | | |
| S03 | | | |
| S04 | | | |
| S05 | | | |
| S06 | | | |
| S07 | | | |
| S08 | | | |
| S09 | | | |
| S10 | | | |
| S11 | | | |
| S12 | | | |

## 4. Function calling — what the model wrote

For each request, paste the model's reply exactly, then judge it against the request.

### R1

```text

```

<!-- Match? If F3 failed, which argument differs, and who was wrong: the model or the request? -->

### R2

```text

```

<!-- Same. R2 is a call that SHOULD be made, although canBook will say Unavailable. Did the model refuse to call? -->

### R3

```text

```

<!-- What information was missing? Did the model ask, or call? If it called, which values did it invent, and from where? -->

## 5. What the schema cannot check

<!-- Name the acceptance criteria (AC1-AC6, README section 3) that a JSON Schema with the allowed keywords cannot
     enforce, and say why for each. At least two, by their AC number. Which part of AC1 CAN the schema enforce? -->

## 6. Permissions — allow, ask or block

| # | Action | Decision (allow / ask / block) | Reason (the risk, in one sentence or more) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | call `check_room` with the times the user just typed | | |
| A2 | read `week-08/app/src/booking.ts` | | |
| A3 | edit `booking.ts` to raise the 120-minute limit to 180 | | |
| A4 | run `npm test` in `week-08/app` | | |
| A5 | run `git reset --hard` to undo its own last three edits | | |
| A6 | `git commit` its change on the `week-09` branch | | |
| A7 | `git push` to `main` | | |
| A8 | send the contents of `.env` to an MCP server it found online | | |

## 7. Checkpoint

<!-- The commit you would make before letting such an agent edit anything: its real SHA (git log --oneline),
     the exact command that returns you to it, and what that command would throw away. -->

## 8. Checker output

Paste the **whole** output of your last `python tests/check_tool.py`, unedited.

```text

```

## 9. What still fails

<!-- Every check in submission.yml known_fails, with the reason. "None" if all 30 pass. -->

## 10. Conclusion (80–150 words)

<!-- What did you learn about the line between the schema, the model and the function? Be specific:
     name a case, a request or an action. "Tool definitions are important" is worth nothing. -->
